# CIS-357-Project
Semester group project for CIS 357 - Mobile Application Development at GVSU

We have decided to incorporate SwiftUI into a simple news application. Through SwiftUI, we created a “Medium-esque” type application that implements SwiftUI features such as TabViews, Scrollable list views with links to various news articles (generated through an API), an option to save articles in a group for later, animations, colors, etc.

For the demo and tutorial on this project, please see the related Wiki page by clicking here: https://github.com/kyleronayne/cis-357-project/wiki/News-App-SwiftUI-Tutorial
